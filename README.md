12. i was intimidated bcs its my first hard graph problem, i havent tried the 2nd part again yet, i was sure i was right but it wasnt the right answer, ill rewrite the whole thing to make it more understandable and eliminate the wierd logics in it.
13. ok
14. ok
15. ok
16. ok
17. ok
18. i wanted to try doing it with binary tree, but the instructions were so much it felt too much, i then looked for hints at reddit and remembered that i can do it with strings, but it was already day 19 as i played with the bois today, so im skipping this for now
19. i played with the bois again, day 20 is open too now, this one is too hard, skipping for now since i dont want it to drain me and prevent me from finishing day 20
20. ok
21. i couldnt get my head around that multi universe concept, even after watching solution videos, ill leave it for now
22. i knew my code wont work for pt 2, but i still enjoyed writing it. i know pt 2 would take cube intersections, but i was too busy with work today
23. i tried to do it manually, i also tried to code it but kept getting into infinite loops inside recursive calls, i thought doing it manually would also be a fun thing to try out, at least after wrecking my brain with trying to debug recursive calls
24. i coded the bruteforce but its not feasible, i noticed the input had patterns in it so i put it in a spreadsheet and tried to analyze the patterns, eventually i solved it there using spreadsheet formulas
25. bruh i need to get all the previous stars to get the last star? guess ill try again next year
